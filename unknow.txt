1. Set Up Your Studio
Download Roblox Studio: This is the essential engine where all the magic happens. It’s free and available for Windows and macOS.

Log In: Use your standard Roblox account.

2. Choose Your Starting Point
Template vs. Baseplate: Start with a Baseplate (empty world) if you want full control.

Themed Templates: Choose a template like "Obby" or "Racing" if you want a pre-built foundation to modify.

3. Build Your World
Parts: Use the Part button to add blocks, spheres, or wedges.

Transform Tools: Use Move, Scale, and Rotate to shape your environment.

Anchor Everything: This is the #1 rookie mistake! Select your parts and hit the Anchor button so they don't fall over when the game starts.

4. Add Gameplay Logic (Scripting)
Lua Basics: Roblox uses Luau, a simple version of the Lua programming language.

Scripts: Right-click an object in the Explorer and select Insert Object > Script to make things move, kill players, or give points.

5. Create the User Interface (UI)
StarterGui: Use this folder to add buttons, health bars, or inventory screens that appear on the player's screen.

6. Test and Refine
- Playtest: Hit the blue Play button at the top to jump into your world as a player.

- The Output Window: Keep this open to see if your scripts are throwing any errors (red text).

7. Publish to the World
File > Publish to Roblox: Give your game a name, description, and an eye-catching thumbnail.

Permissions: Set the game to Public so others can join the fun.
